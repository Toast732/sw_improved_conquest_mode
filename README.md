# Improved Conquest Mode
## A Stormworks addon that greatly improves upon the default conquest mode, with features such as Adaptive AI, Land AI Pathfinding, Scouting AI, New Vehicles, and tons of other balance changes, improvements, bug fixes and optimisations!

## Download
You can download the addon from the workshop page [here](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2722478864)

## What is different?
There are ton of changes here, so many in fact that they all can't be listed here. Some examples include:
- AI Planes no longer divebomb.
- Boats will have to sink before being destroyed
- Eurofighter can now shoot missiles
- Island Contesting
- Vehicles now have to go closer to their base to reload
- Tanks and Cars can move around roads and will take shortcuts.
- Several new vehicles
- Tons of balance and bug fixes
- Land AI Pathfinding support for Donkk, the keys and Sawyer.
- AI will learn your stratigies and use your weaknesses against you (Adapative AI).
- Tons More!

## Oh. Why should I use this instead of the default?
Because this one fixes multiple bugs over the default, which actually makes this one more optimised than the defualt.
Also, its alot more balanced, such as AI using K and AP instead of HE ammo, removing the AA tank as it was better at killing land and sea vehicles but was trash at killing air vehicles, added VLS to the destroyer ship and also replaced some vehicles with more detailed versions!

## How can I contribute?
Either reach out to Toastery#2075 on Discord, join the Discord server [here](https://discord.gg/v7yf39kBZJ), or create a PR.
You can create vehicles, edit the code, suggest things, or just play it! All of these are excellent ways to contribute.
